# Automated case status lookup
Tired of checking if my work permit has been approved, I automated the process so I can get a text with the status update everyday at 9 am. 
To setup the project, do the following:
1. Setup a virtual env.
2.Install all dependencies:
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the python file as follows:
`python3 request.py`
